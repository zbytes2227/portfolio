Users can also check the attendance of a particular student or a specific date. We have sold this system to a coaching center, which is using it to manage the attendance of over 100 students. The special feature of this machine is that attendance can be viewed from anywhere in the world using a phone. I have also developed a second version of this device that works offline, saving data directly to an SD card without needing WiFi. I am still working on this project.",
